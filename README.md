Notice that the smart phone automatically connected to the router. Devices normally do not connect right away without first being configured. you can change your configuration of your devices in packet tracer by double clicking on the device to bring up a more detailed view. Below is the gui view for the home router. Here we can change all of the settings for the router such as the IP address, DHCP, and security settings to name a few.

Lastly we will connect our PC and our laptop to the router with an ethernet cable
